# This script creates a version of the Equi7Grid that contains no overlaps across regions
# This can be used to summarize data to ensure that areas are not counted more than once
# as per Simkin et al 2024 - Global exposure to zoonotic diseases in the wildland-urban interface


# The following must be saved locally:
# - Natural Earth country boundaries can be downloaded here: https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-cultural-vectors/
# - World Bank income groups can be downloaded here: https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups

# The script contains paths to these files that need to be updated
# Ouptput location must also be updated manually
